  <h1>High School Wrestling</h1>
  <p>During my high school wrestling career I was a 2x Wisconsin State Wrestling Champion at the 152 and 170 lb weight classes. High school did not start off easy for me though. As a freshman in high school, I almost did not make the starting lineup on my Varsity team. I remember feeling devastated. When I lost my wrestle off to my fellow teammate at the start of the wrestling season my freshman year, it pushed me and motivated me to get even better. After going up a few weight classes I ended off that year as a Wisconsin State qualifier. My sophomore year of high school I began to grow into my body a little bit more and after a long season of very hard work, I took third place at the Wisconsin State tournament.That summer I remember I had a very productive summer of training. Going into my junior year of high school, I was feeling great. Junior year of high school, I had the most success I've ever had in my wrestling career up to that point. I won lots of tournaments that I had not won previously, and going into the state tournament I was ranked #2. The bracket that I was in junior year for state was very competitive and every guy looking back was very talented. I ended up making the state finals. The first time I wrestled at the Kohl Center in Madison, WI, in front of 15,000 people, it was a shock to me. I remember stepping up to the line and weirdly enough, all my anxiety faded away. It was almost as though all the fans that were looking at me sucked all the anxiety and self doubt away. In a super close and competitive match, I ended up winning because of a last second takedown and I became a Wisconsin State champion. I was riding the high of being a state champion for most of the summer, but there was still work to be done. After I had accomplished this goal my sights shifted to college. I couldn't overlook my senior year of high school just yet, but I did start to look at where I could potentially wrestle in college.This meant that I had to compete in national tournaments and not just compete, but win. My senior year of high school I was very dominant and I didn't really have any close matches. I went an undefeated 47-0 and took home another Wisconsin State title in dominant fashion. I remember getting my hand raised after my victory in the Kohl Center for another year in a row. I held up a W with my hands to signify my commitment to the University of Wisconsin, and the crowd went nuts. To this day, that remains one of the most heartfelt memories I have.</p>
